This website was made for my dads company. Note, all the written text/titles/images are copied from his website he is currently using: https://www.p-consulting.ca/

Test website on GitHub-Pages: https://kaedonfoster.github.io/MakerProjectWebpage/

I made this website by myself after folling guides on w3 schools! If I ever ran into a problem along the way, I opened google and searched up my problem. 
For exmaple: "how to make a button rediret to another page using javascript"

For my contact guide of my website, i used smtpjs.com. It is a javascript script that allows you to send messages through javascript rather than php.
